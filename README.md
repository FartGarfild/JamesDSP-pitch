Pitcher created by used AI, but work correctly.

Feature: when mixing Dry/Wet, a pre-echo effect occurs due to the specifics of the window treatment. It sounds best at Dry -15 dB

For standard listening, use windows size up to 300 ms, but if you want to dive into granular chaos and metal destruction, change the limit in the code to 1000 ms and turn on the pitch at -10.
