Worked in android devices. Testet in rootless JamesDSP


Feature: when mixing Dry/Wet, a pre-echo effect occurs due to the specifics of the window treatment. It sounds best at Dry -15 dB

For standard listening, use windows size up to 100-300 ms, but if you want to dive into granular chaos and metal destruction, change the limit to 1000 ms and turn on the pitch at -10.

at high pitch values it is better to set the buffer to minimum to eliminate the sawtooth effect

standart parameters:
pitch: 0
windows size: 150
dry mix: -120
buffers: 4

robot voice effect.
pitch: -3
windows size: 30
dry mix: -5
buffers: 32
